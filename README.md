# common utils
## Introduction

Common utils was born as a project in january 2012 when we found out that we often wrote the same methods again and again in different projects. To be a bit more efficient we wanted to make a library that had all this functionality to simply implement in any java project. 

## So what utilities does this include?

We haven't currently released anything yet. This lib is still in it's start phase. But when we release it will have functionality for: 
* Database connection tools
* File handling
* FTP
* Simple image handling 
* Encryption

We will try to update this README as we progress.
