#SUIVEG::CommonUtils

##Introduction

Common utils was created/born as a project in January 2012 when Marius and Vegard found out that we way too often wrote the same code over and over again in many different projects. To be a bit more efficient we started to create a small library that had all this functionality built in. This has proven to be a great idea, and we're using this library many places right now. 

If you like it, why not just fork the ever on-going "project", and submit your own additions? 

Enjoy it, we do!

##So what utilities does this include?

We have functionality for the following elements in this project:

* Database connection tools
* File handling
* FTP
* Simple image handling 
* Encryption

We will try to update this README as we progress.
You can also visit our [old google code page](http://code.google.com/p/common-utils-suiveg/) (note: this is a dead project-page, please do not check out the code from that location. Thanks).

##Majors to be done

We are working with TDD for this project at the moment, but it is far from finalized. Updates will arrive every now and then!
